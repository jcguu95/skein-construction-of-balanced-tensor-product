CHANGE (1.1.1 <- 1.1.0):

The remaining tasks were addressed with minor fixes. We compiled this version
into a PDF, virtually printed it, and submitted it to arXiv around 2025-01-09
23:30:00 Mountain Time. We are now awaiting their decision.

CHANGE (1.1.0 <- 1.0.3):

This upgrade introduces several significant changes. Notably, Manuel rewrote
almost all the proofs, broke down Jin's constructions into smaller, more
manageable steps, and replaced certain proofs with well-known categorical
theorems. Additionally, Manuel added a proof to address the non-semisimple
case.

Jin and Manuel collaborated to resolve numerous outstanding tasks. At this
stage, the plan is for Skyler to thoroughly review everything. If no issues
are found, we aim to submit this version to arXiv soon.

------

CHANGE (1.0.3 <- 1.0.2):

1. Rewrite some parts in the introduction by make the following clear: (1)
   advantages of our methods (2) the applications. Declare that we do not
   claim any novelty of the main idea in this paper.

2. Add a new application: A short and simple reproof for Kirillov+Tham2020,
   which shows that Crane-Yetter model is a factorization homology.

3. Start counting from section 1, instead of 0.

4. Change "subobject" to "retract", and mention it as a general fact about
   Karoubi completion.

5. Move the Basis Theorem into the appendix, as it is not used anywhere in the
   paper.

6. Mention that "rigidity" may be enough for our work, instead of the stronger
   condition "pivotality" that we currently use.

7. Add a (hidden) TODO in the tex source file: Manuel may want to provide an
   alternate clever proof (or at least a sketch) for the main lemma.

8. Address Manuel's worry on whether we should add idempotents for matrices of
   skeins as well while doing Karoubi completion. (cf the text in version 3:
   "Thus, a typical object of the skein category sk(M, C, N) is the direct sum
   of some idempotent skeins [..]")
