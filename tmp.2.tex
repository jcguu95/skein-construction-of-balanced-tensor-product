% The main theorem provides an algebraic model for balanced tensor products with
% mathematical rigor, utilizing the skein construction. We do not claim to
% introduce novel ideas here: This approach closely mirrors the domain-wall
% perspective in topological phase theory, as outlined in
% \cite{kong/topological-order}. In fact, the essential techniques have been
% used in many places to study the Drinfeld center
% $Z(C) \simeq C \boxtimes_{CC} C$ (e.g. \cite{kirillov/string-net-tv}). This
% work is merely a generalization of it to the context of field theories with
% defects.

% In this work, we assume ideal conditionsâ€”finiteness, semisimplicity, and
% rigidity (see \ref{subsection/preliminaries}). While it is both possible and
% beneficial to relax some of these assumptions, for simplicity, we leave such
% generalizations for future work.
