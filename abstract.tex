The theory of tensor categories has found applications across various fields,
including representation theory \cite{egno/tensor-cats}, quantum field theory
(conformal in 2 dimensions \cite{schweigert/rcft-tft} \cite{yadav/gv-voa}, and
topological in 3 and 4 dimensions), quantum invariants of low-dimensional
objects \cite{turaev/big-book} \cite{beliakova/low-dim-topo}, topological
phases of matter \cite{levin-wen/string-net} \cite{kong/topological-order}
\cite{ng/md-rank-11}, and topological quantum computation
\cite{wang/topo-quantum-compute}. In essence, it is a categorification of the
classical theory of algebras and modules. In this analogy, the Deligne tensor
product $\boxtimes$ is to the linear tensor product $\otimes$ as the
balanced tensor product $\boxtimes_{C}$ over a tensor category $C$ is to the 
tensor product $\otimes_{A}$ over an algebra $A$.

Before this work, several algebraic constructions for balanced tensor products
were known, including categories of modules \cite{douglas/balanced-product},
internal Hom spaces \cite{davydov/picard}, and generalized categorical centers
\cite{etingof/fusion-cat-and-homotopy} \cite{kirillov/fact-homo-4d-tqft}
\cite{hoek/master}. In this paper, we introduce a topological construction
based on skein theory that offers a better mix of algebra and topology. This
approach generalises nicely to products of multiple module categories. It also 
provides a new approach to relating the Turaev-Viro state sum model
\cite{viro/turaev-viro-model} to the $3$-functor coming from the
classification of fully extended topological field theories 
(\cite{lurie/tqft},\cite{douglas/dualizable-tensor-categories}), which we are pursuing
as work in progress.
