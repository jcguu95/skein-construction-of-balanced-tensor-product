The theory of tensor categories has found applications across various fields,
including representation theory \cite{egno/tensor-cats}, quantum field theory
(conformal in 2 dimensions \cite{schweigert/rcft-tft} \cite{yadav/gv-voa}, and
topological in 3 and 4 dimensions), quantum invariants of low-dimensional
objects \cite{turaev/big-book} \cite{beliakova/low-dim-topo}, topological
phases of matter \cite{kong/topological-order}, and topological quantum
computation \cite{wang/topo-quantum-compute}. In essence, it is a
categorification of the classical theory of algebras and modules. In this
analogy, the Deligne tensor product $\boxtimes$ generalizes the linear tensor
product $\otimes_{\mathbb{C}}$, while the balanced tensor product
$\boxtimes_{C}$ extends the tensor product over an algebra $\otimes_{A}$,
where $\mathbb{C}$ is a field, $A$ is a $\mathbb{C}$-algebra, and $C$ is a
tensor category.

Before this work, several algebraic constructions for balanced tensor products
were known, including categories of modules \cite{douglas/balanced-product},
internal Hom spaces \cite{davydov/picard}, and generalized categorical centers
\cite{etingof/fusion-cat-and-homotopy} \cite{kirillov/fact-homo-4d-tqft}
\cite{hoek/master}. In this paper, we introduce a topological construction
based on skein theory that offers a better mix of algebra and topology. This
approach not only works for products of multiple module categories, but also
provides the missing key to proving that the Turaev-Viro state sum model
\cite{viro/turaev-viro-model} naturally arises from the 3-functor in the
classification of fully extended field theories \cite{lurie/tqft}. Building on
this result, we establish this long-anticipated proof in
\cite{guu/tv-as-3-functor}.
