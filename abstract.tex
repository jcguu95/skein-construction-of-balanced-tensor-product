The balanced tensor product $M \boxtimes_{C} N$ (where $C$ is a tensor
  category and $M_{C}, _{C}N$ are $C$-module categories) is a generalization
  of the Deligne tensor product, categorifying the classical theory of
  algebras and modules. It proves to find applications in several areas:
  representation theory, (conformal and topological) quantum field theory, and
  topological phases.

The balanced tensor product is defined via a universal property, which is
  satisfied by a few constructions using, for example, category of bimodules
  and generalized center constructions. The existing constructions fall short
  by obscuring the topological and the skein-theoretical nature of these
  products, making computations and connections to topological quantum field
  theories difficult.

This paper propose a skein-theoretic construction for the balanced tensor
  product. It simplifies these computations and clarifies the relationship
  between the Turaev-Viro state sum and fully extended 3D TQFTs. This approach
  is expected to extend to 4D models, including the Crane-Yetter state sum,
  and aid in the study of vertex operator algebras and topological phases.
